# Description of the problem
Consider the problem of finding the shortest 
path between two points on a plane that has convex polygonal obstacles. This is an 
idealization of the problem that a robot has to solve to navigate in a crowded environment. 
Suppose all positions (x,y) in the plane are known. How many paths are there to the goal?  
The shortest path from one polygon vertex to any other in the scene consists of 
straight-line segments joining some of the vertices of the polygons. .Define the necessary 
functions to implement the search problem, including function action() that takes a vertex as 
input and returns a set of vectors, each of which maps the current vertex to one of the 
vertices that can be reached in a straight line. Use the straight-line distance for the heuristic 
function. Create a class of environment, traveler, and other useful classes. The class traveler 
includes methods of thinking, acting,moving and others. Create, compile and implement a 
program.
